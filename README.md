# Universal Slack Search
Bring Slack Search wherever you are, Universal Slack Search is a simple Alfred workflow to toggle Slack Search visibility no matter which application is on focus. It leverages keyboard shortcuts, so some misbehaviors are expected (please report if you notice them, we can try to figure it out how to workaround it).

## Toggle Slack Search
**Option + E**: Bring Slack search or hide Slack with a single (and one hand) shortcut.
